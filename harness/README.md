# harness/ — the oracle + emulator factory (C)

Everything that builds and *judges* the artifact, written in **C only**
(CLAUDE.md Law 3, PRD §14). The emulator is the fitness signal: nothing
ships on "looks right" — every subsystem is gated by a mechanical oracle
here (PRD §8, §9).

Layout:

- `emu/` — emulator drivers: `qemu.c`, `bochs.c`, `box86.c`. Wire the gdb
  stub, QMP `screendump`, serial markers, and the tri-emulator differential
  (CLAUDE.md Rule 5, PRD §8).
- `ssim.c` — per-window SSIM fidelity *guide* against the frame fixtures.
  A guide that points agents toward fidelity, **not** a hard numeric gate
  (CLAUDE.md Law 4, PRD §3).
- `diff/` — the differential suites: `fat_diff` (vs mtools/python),
  `dbf_diff` (vs real dBASE), `compiler_diff` (vs Free Pascal).
- `proptest/` — the ATKINSON region property suite + shrinker: the
  homomorphism, normal-form, and algebra-identity oracle (PRD §6.2).

`harness/factory_smoke.c` is the current placeholder proving the C factory
toolchain compiles and runs (beads `initech-tse`); it will be superseded by
the real harness components above.

Governed by: **PRD §8, §9, §10, §14.**
